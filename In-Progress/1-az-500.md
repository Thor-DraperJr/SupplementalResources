## Configure AAD for work
### Create App Registration
App registration (AAD Premium P2, Global Admin):
- this application can bu authorized an used by users
- any user who is a member of the AD can register an app(not a guest user)
 - an equivalent of adding a workstation to a domain

* AAD - contains a unique tenant ID
1. Navigate the left pane to App registration
2. New Registration
    * Name
    * Single tenant = default [Any Azure AD - Multitenant/ + personal Microsoft]
    * Redirect URI (optional)
        * Web = default (used for most authentication scenarios. mandates https)
3. Register

* ISV: independent software vendor

### Configure App Registration permission scopes
#### Terms
* scoping
* delegated permisstions = app interacts with a signed in user and binds proper constraints
* OAuth 2.0 = permissions are called scope

- In the left pane for Authentication it allows you to manage URI's for redirects

API permissions = Configured permissions

Microsoft Graph is the default microsoft provided permission to 'Sign in and read user profile', can be removed but shouldn't.

Adding an API permission
Options: Microsoft APIs, 
Supported legacy apps are on the bottom

Types of permissions: Delegated permissions (The application assumes the persona of the user to behave on behalf of the user) / Application permissions (no signed in users needed)

### Manage App Resgistration permission consent
proves right person to right level of access. 

Grants consent on behalf of the users in the AADD

**Tip:** https://myapps.microsoft.com

### Configure Multi-Factor Authentication security
* Security > Left pane, under the Manage subsection
* Click MFA
    * Account Lockout - specify locoucks for too man denials in a row that only applies to users who enter a PIN to authenticate
        * number of denials to trigger, minute s until rest, minutes until account is unblocked
    * Block/unblock users
        * Adding a user - prevents them from receiving the MFA prompt (auto blocked for 90 days)
    * Fraud Alert - allows user to report fraud if they receive a two-step verification request
        * Default is off
    * Notifications - the global admin is automatically listed
        * One-time bypass = a temporary allow for a user to authenticate for a default time period [default is 300 seconds - 5 min.]
        * Activity report = can see who has activated and usage logs
    * in the security section > Named locations > Configure MFA IPs
        * allows for whitelisting internal IPs
        * allows for remembering MFA for a set amount of days for trusted devices

### Manage Azure AD directory groups
* two-stage deletion process
* export capability
* naming convention controls
