## Configure AAD for work
### Create App Registration
App registration (AAD Premium P2, Global Admin):
- this application can bu authorized an used by users
- any user who is a member of the AD can register an app(not a guest user)
 - an equivalent of adding a workstation to a domain

* AAD - contains a unique tenant ID
1. Navigate the left pane to App registration
2. New Registration
    * Name
    * Single tenant = default [Any Azure AD - Multitenant/ + personal Microsoft]
    * Redirect URI (optional)
        * Web = default (used for most authentication scenarios. mandates https)
3. Register

* ISV: independent software vendor

### Configure App Registration permission scopes
#### Terms
* scoping
* delegated permisstions = app interacts with a signed in user and binds proper constraints
* OAuth 2.0 = permissions are called scope

- In the left pane for Authentication it allows you to manage URI's for redirects

API permissions = Configured permissions

Microsoft Graph is the default microsoft provided permission to 'Sign in and read user profile', can be removed but shouldn't.

Adding an API permission
Options: Microsoft APIs, 
Supported legacy apps are on the bottom

Types of permissions: Delegated permissions (The application assumes the persona of the user to behave on behalf of the user) / Application permissions (no signed in users needed)

### Manage App Resgistration permission consent
proves right person to right level of access. 

Grants consent on behalf of the users in the AADD

**Tip:** https://myapps.microsoft.com

### Configure Multi-Factor Authentication security
* Security > Left pane, under the Manage subsection
* Click MFA
    * Account Lockout - specify locoucks for too man denials in a row that only applies to users who enter a PIN to authenticate
        * number of denials to trigger, minute s until rest, minutes until account is unblocked
    * Block/unblock users
        * Adding a user - prevents them from receiving the MFA prompt (auto blocked for 90 days)
    * Fraud Alert - allows user to report fraud if they receive a two-step verification request
        * Default is off
    * Notifications - the global admin is automatically listed
        * One-time bypass = a temporary allow for a user to authenticate for a default time period [default is 300 seconds - 5 min.]
        * Activity report = can see who has activated and usage logs
    * in the security section > Named locations > Configure MFA IPs
        * allows for whitelisting internal IPs
        * allows for remembering MFA for a set amount of days for trusted devices

### Manage Azure AD directory groups
* two-stage deletion process
* export capability
* naming convention controls

* types of groups: security, distribution, Office365, on-prem

**can only manage on-prem ON-PREM**

Navigate to AAD > Manage > Groups
* In groups
    * Settings
        * General
            * Self Service Group Management - owners can manage membership request in the access panel
            * Security Groups
            * Office 365 Groups
            * Directory-wide Groups
        * Expiration
            * useful for business cycles or project driven needs to timebound a group
            * Group lifetime (in days)
            * Notification for expiration reminders hapen 30, 15, 1 day (email only)
            * if not renewed the group is deleted
        * Naming policy
            * Blocked words - .csv of banned words (profanity, internal anames) and upload the csv
            * Group naming policy - unique only to Office 365 groups
                * add prefix / add suffix
    * Bulk operation results
        * you can export all groups from the main group page
        * hosts the results where you can download in a csv
        * does not contain memberships
        * useful for auditing what groups exists / automation

#### Deleting groups
- You can initially delete from the group list
- Navigate to Deleted groups 
    - You can Delete permanently or restore
    - Groups are held in delete for 30 days

#### Managing Licenses
- Choose a Security Group
    - Licenses
        - You can select licenses and services you want to enable or disable

### Manage Azure AD Users
- Roles and administrators
    - how you give and assign users roles and delegated rights

#### User v Guest User
- User = Known as members [Internal accounts]
    - Either AAD or Windows Server AD
- Guest Users = outside of the organization (contractors, end-users)
    - Invited User
    - Can be created or invited
        - creating a new user in the org will allow you to create and apply a domain (say you need it for multiple business units to give access to named directories). you can reset passwords
        - inviting a user creates the account as the invite is sent

#### Deleting a User
- You need to go into the username from the menu
- Deleted users go into the 'Deleted users' option
    - can be permanently delted or restored (30 day)

#### Password Reset
- You can enable 'Self service passwords'
    - Apply to end users in your oganization
    - Admins auto-enrolled
    - require two methods of verification

#### User Settings
- Admin portal
- LinkedIn Account SSO

#### Roles and Administators
- Assignments : allow you to choose users (like application admin or application developer)

*you can manage licenses to users the same way*

### Install and Configure Azure AD Connect
* AD Connect tool
    * Express Install - requires a routable (.com) domain
        * Customize Install
            * Specify a custom installation location = Default is C:\Program Files\Microsoft
        * User sign-in
        * Connecting to Azure AD = Requires Global admin credentials
* For SSO Create a GPO
    * Site to Zone Assignment List > Edit to enable
        * https://autologon.microsoftazuread-sso.com | Data: 1

    * **Tip** Must be 2012 or newer
    * Ideally domain joined not the DC

### Configure Authentication Methods
* Do you want Azure AD to handle Sign-in COMPLETELY in the cloud?

* Hash sychronize is a big factor in between on-prem / cloud envirnements because both environments need to sychronize for changes

* You can add multiple authentication methods

* Seamless SSO = allows users to us the same credentials to access other Azure resources

* Pass-through = No integrated federation, no 

##### Define the options after looking into the portal****

### Implement Conditional Access policies
* Conditional access
    * signals - users, endpoint type OS 
    * decisions - what you grant to the user

* AAD
    * Security > Conditional Access | Policies
        * Policy types: 
            * Baseline - msft defaults
            * Standard - admin created and modified
            * Classic - legacy policies

While creating policies the default is to Report-only to see how policies would be applied.

### Configure Azure AD Identity protection
In Azure AD - Premium P2 > Security > Identity Protection

* Overview
    * Scorecard data
        * Contains 90 days of historical data
    * New Risky sign-ins
        * Relation to baseline/standard policies

* Protect | Sign-in risk policy
    * Assign Users
    * Conditions
        * risk level
    * Controls
        * Block, allow
        * Require MFA
    * Enforce the Policy or not for users

* Leaked credentials - if your credentials show up on an online db [dark web id?]

* Notify | 
    * add additional users

*Global Admin isn't the only account that has access to this tab. Global reader, security reader and others are able to view Identity Protection(good fit for cso)*

## Configure Azure AD Priveleged Identity Management

### Activate Privileged Identity Management

Search Azure AD Priveleged Identity Managment (launches the blade)

PIM allos JIT (just in time) management. To give a fixed amount of time (ex. a business day) Time bounding use of time

RBAC

* Activity
    * My audit history-

### Monitor Privieleged Access
- Licensing
    - Premium P2, E5 (ERM brings P2)
    - roles every administrator other than global admins needs a license for PIM
    - users managed by PIM need it, approvers need it, and reviewers need it
    - Users assigned as eligible to Azure AD roles managed using PIM
    - Users able to approve or reject activation requests in PIM
    - Users assigned to an Azure resource role with just-in-time or direct

The top 10 Azure AD roles managed by Privileged Identity Management are:

1. Global administrator
2. Security administrator
3. User administrator
4. Exchange administrator
5. SharePoint administrator
6. Intune administrator
7. Security reader
8. Service administrator
9. Billing administrator
10. Skype for Business administrator


PIM emails for Azure resource roles - Privileged Identity Management sends emails to Owners and User Access Administrators when the following events occur for Azure resource roles:

* When a role assignment is pending approval
* When a role is assigned
* When a role is soon to expire
* When a role is eligible to extend
* When a role is being renewed by an end user
* When a role activation request is completed

Privileged Identity Management sends emails to end users when the following events occur for Azure resource roles:

* When a role is assigned to the user
* When a user's role is expired
* When a user's role is extended
* When a user's role activation request is completed

### Configure Access Reviews

* Prerequistes
    * Azure AD Premium P2
    * Global admin or User admin

Navigate to Azure AD > Identity Governance
* Access reviews
    * Access reviews
        * Create an access review
            * Review name*
            * Description
            * Start date*
            * Frequency
            * End [Never, End by, Occurances]
            * Users
            * Scope - *You would need to create two if you wanted to audit both groups*
                * Guests
                * Everyone (does not include Guests)

Reviews are hosted at myaccess.microsoft.com

## Configure Azure tenant security

### Transfer Azure subs between Azure AD tenants
Navigate to 'Cost Management + Billing' 

* Billing
    * Subscriptions - In the options you can hit the elipses

You do this by emailing the subscription. You can change billing admins not necessarirly the entire tenant.

This removes RBAC permissions to manage Azure resources in the subscription

### Manage API access Azure subscriptions and resources

Authentication and Authorization steps

#### OAuth 2.0
The basic steps required to use the OAuth 2.0 authorization code grant flow to get an access token from the Microsoft identity platform endpoint are:

1. Register your app with Azure AD
2. Get authorization (/authorize endpoint) & Consent Experience
3. Get an access token (/token endpoint)
4. Call Microsoft Graph with the access token
5. Use a refresh token to get a new access token

## Implement network security

## Configure container security
