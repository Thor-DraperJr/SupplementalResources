# IP Spoofing

Spoofing is an impersonation of a user, device or client on the Internet. It’s often used during a cyberattack to disguise the source of attack traffic.

The most common forms of spoofing are:

* DNS server spoofing – Modifies a DNS server in order to redirect a domain name to a different IP address. It’s typically used to spread viruses.
* ARP spoofing – Links a perpetrator’s MAC address to a legitimate IP address through spoofed

## What is IP address spoofing

Computer networks communicate through the exchange of network data packets, each containing multiple headers used for routing and to ensure transmission continuity. One such header is the ‘Source IP Address’, which indicates the IP address of the packet’s sender. IP address spoofing is the act of falsifying the content in the Source IP header, usually with randomized numbers, either to mask the sender’s identity or to launch a reflected DDoS attack, as described below. IP spoofing is a default feature in most DDoS malware kits and attack scripts, making it a part of most network layer distributed denial of service DDoS attacks.

## TCP sequence prediction attack

A TCP sequence prediction attack is an attempt to predict the sequence number used to identify the packets in a TCP connection, which can be used to counterfeit packets. The attacker hopes to correctly guess the sequence number to be used by the sending host. If they can do this, they will be able to send counterfeit packets to the receiving host which will seem to originate from the sending host, even though the counterfeit packets may in fact originate from some third host controlled by the attacker. One possible way for this to occur is for the attacker to listen to the conversation occurring between the trusted hosts, and then to issue packets using the same source IP address. By monitoring the traffic before an attack is mounted, the malicious host can figure out the correct sequence number. After the IP address and the correct sequence number are known, it is basically a race between the attacker and the trusted host to get the correct packet sent. One common way for the attacker to send it first is to launch another attack on the trusted host, such as a Denial-of-Service attack. Once the attacker has control over the connection, it is able to send counterfeit packets without getting a response.
