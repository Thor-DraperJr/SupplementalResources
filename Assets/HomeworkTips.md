# Advice on Homework
What up, class! I just wanted to give some advice on how you should handle homework as we progress through the course.
Be mindful of the situation presented at the beginning of the assignment. Some will say that you've just been hired as a security analyst (ex. Week 3 HW). In that situation, that means that you have a client, and they are asking for deliverables.

## Pitfalls to avoid:

* As you progress in your technical skill - don't assume the client has the same technical knowledge as you. Level setting acronyms, explaining technical terms, and providing screenshots can go a long way to make sure your point is coming across.
* Keep in mind that you should treat all assignments as if they were deliverables for work. If your boss asked you to do a research assignment, you wouldn't just take a bunch of pictures, print them out, stuff them into a manilla folder, and then toss it on your boss's desk. (For instance - in this assignment, it says to zip the files and submit them. While doing that may fulfill the requirement, it doesn't give us any room to understand your thought process.)
* The reason we write assignments that create a situation that hires you on a role to conduct a particular task is to make sure your documentation skills are up to par when you get into that role.

## Tips:

* Use the assignment's readme as a framework. If you copy and paste the text into the google folder you are working in, it's an easy way to make sure that you don't miss any aspects of the homework, and rewrite the question (or the ask) is always a solid technique!
* Office hourse are a good resource for Instructor/TA help with any oddball commands or issues.
* Requesting a Tutor is really helpful for those that would like 1:1 attention
