# What up

## Supplemental Resources

Welcome to the "Supplemental Resources" repository, a treasure trove of wisdom, insights, and tools I've gathered throughout my career in IT and cybersecurity. This collection, which may at first glance seem like the eclectic notes of a passionate professional, serves a purpose far greater than its seemingly scatterbrained appearance suggests.

I started putting this together while I was teaching a few cohorts for EdX. I've recognized the value in having a centralized hub of resources for those transitioning into or navigating the complex world of IT. This repository is my contribution to that need - a dedicated space where newcomers and seasoned professionals alike can find guidance, inspiration, and the tools necessary for their journey.

In addition to the resources found here, I share my thoughts, experiences, and the occasional epiphany through blog posts on [LinkedIn](www.linkedin.com/in/thor-draperjr) and my [personal website](www.thor-draperjr.github.io). These writings complement the repository, offering deeper insights and reflections on the ever-evolving landscape of technology and cybersecurity.

Good luck!
